/**
 * Active AI provider — single source of truth, durable across launches.
 *
 * Previously split between `src/ai/chat.ts` (in-memory `activeProvider`
 * module state) and Settings screen mutations. That left two control
 * planes in the AI layer (review finding #16), and it also meant a
 * reboot didn't remember which provider the user had selected — the
 * composer picked the first keychain-ordered configured provider,
 * which isn't necessarily what the user last chose (finding #5).
 *
 * This module is the only thing that writes / reads the selection:
 *   - Settings calls `saveActiveProvider(p)` on selection.
 *   - `buildBootInputs` calls `loadActiveProvider()` so the agentic
 *     loop uses whatever the user picked.
 *   - Legacy `src/ai/chat.ts` re-exports a synchronous peek helper so
 *     its `processMessage` can still gate the LLM path.
 *
 * The in-memory cache mirrors the keychain so synchronous consumers
 * (render-time reads in Settings) don't need to await every time.
