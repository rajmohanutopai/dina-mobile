/**
 * Trust level assignment and cache semantics.
 *
 * Trust hierarchy (lowest → highest): blocked < unknown < verified < trusted
 *
 * Behavioral rules:
 *   blocked  → silently drop messages (no sharing, no quarantine)
 *   unknown  → quarantine messages (no sharing, pending verification)
 *   verified → allow sharing (ZKP-verified identity)
 *   trusted  → allow sharing (credential-verified, full trust)
 *
 * Trust rings:
 *   Ring 1: unverified (unknown entities, high-risk actions require Ring 2+)
 *   Ring 2: ZKP-verified (moderate actions allowed with approval)
 *   Ring 3: credential-verified (full trust, low-friction)
 *
 * Cache: trust level cached locally with 1-hour staleness window.
 * Re-sync from AppView when stale.
