/**
 * QueryWindow — time-limited authorization windows for public-service D2D traffic.
 *
 * Public-service D2D traffic bypasses the contacts-only gate. A window tracks
 * `(peerDID, queryID, capability) → expiry` entries that authorize specific
 * `service.query` / `service.response` messages to skip the contact gate.
 *
 * Two instances are used at runtime:
 *   - `providerWindow`: opened when a `service.query` is accepted from a
 *     stranger. The provider's `service.response` uses `reserve`/`commit` to
 *     consume the window without allowing duplicate sends.
 *   - `requesterWindow`: opened when a `service.query` is sent to a public
 *     service. The requester's inbound `service.response` uses
 *     `checkAndConsume` to accept exactly one reply.
 *
 * Source: core/internal/service/query_window.go
 *
 * Notes on the port:
 *   - Go uses `sync.Mutex`; JS is single-threaded at the bytecode level and
 *     every method here is synchronous, so no locking primitive is needed.
 *     All operations remain linearisable by virtue of the event loop.
 *   - Time is injectable via the `nowFn` option so tests can exercise expiry
 *     deterministically without `setTimeout` flakiness.
 *   - `CleanupLoop` is replaced by a pair of methods (`startCleanupLoop` /
 *     `stopCleanupLoop`) returning a disposer — there is no `context.Context`
 *     equivalent in stock Node; callers clean up with the returned handle.
