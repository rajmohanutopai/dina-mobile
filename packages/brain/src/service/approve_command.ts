/**
 * Default wiring for the `/service_approve` and `/service_deny` chat
 * commands.
 *
 * `/service_approve <taskId>` → `POST /v1/workflow/tasks/:id/approve`. Core
 * moves the approval task `pending_approval → queued` and emits the
 * `approved` workflow-event that Guardian consumes to spawn the delegation
 * task (via `ServiceHandler.executeAndRespond`).
 *
 * `/service_deny <taskId> [reason]` → best-effort `unavailable` response
 * via `POST /v1/service/respond` (so the requester doesn't wait for TTL
 * expiry) followed by `POST /v1/workflow/tasks/:id/cancel`. Mirrors the
 * cleanup order in `ApprovalReconciler.runTick` — errors from respond are
 * isolated since cancel is the authoritative state change.
 *
 * Kept in a separate module from the orchestrator so the orchestrator stays
 * core-client-agnostic (useful for unit tests that stub the handler directly).
 *
