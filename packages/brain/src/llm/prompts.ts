Item with event:

- kind: One of: birthday, appointment, payment_due, deadline, reminder

Respond with ONLY a JSON object:

Rules:
- Create 1-3 reminders per event (e.g., birthday → day-before gift hint + morning-of call reminder)
- For birthdays: add a day-before reminder ("tomorrow is X's birthday") and a morning-of reminder
- For deadlines: add a 1-day-before warning and a morning-of reminder
- For appointments: add a 1-hour-before reminder
- Consolidation: when someone is arriving or multiple events overlap, create ONE reminder with ALL relevant context
- Use vault context to personalize: if the vault mentions the person likes something, include that in the reminder message
- Suggest, don't order: use "You might want to..." not "You must..."
- NEVER fabricate events, dates, or details not mentioned in the item or vault context
- NEVER invent preferences, relationships, or facts — only use what is explicitly stated
- If timezone is provided, compute due_at in that timezone. Otherwise use UTC.

Tone examples:
- "Emma's birthday is tomorrow. She mentioned liking watercolors last month — maybe pick up a set?"
- "Payment for the electricity bill is due tomorrow. The amount was $142."
- "Your dentist appointment is in 1 hour at Dr. Shah's office."`;

- evidence: The exact phrase that indicates the relationship

Respond with ONLY a JSON object:
{"identity_links": [{"name": "<person name>", "relationship": "<relationship type>", "confidence": "<high|medium|low>", "evidence": "<source phrase>"}]}

Rules:
- Only extract EXPLICIT relationship statements — do not infer
- "I met Bob at the store" does NOT imply a relationship (no link)
- "Bob and I discussed the project" implies colleague at most (low confidence)
